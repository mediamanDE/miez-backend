# miez-backend
Backend for MIEZ

## Building
Run `cargo build` to build the executable. Add `--release` to compile it with optimizations (will take longer).

## Running
To run and automatically execute the code, run `cargo run`.

## Check
In order to test whether your code compiles without actually producing an executable, use `cargo check`.
